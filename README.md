## **Magic Shield** 
**Cooldown:** 25 seconds  
**Duration:** 15 seconds (actively drains under certain conditions)  

### **Effects While Active:**  
- **Damage Reduction:** 75% less damage taken.  
- **Stamina Penalty:** Stamina drains faster and regenerates slower.  
- **Healing Boost:** If the player is not at full health, their healing rate increases—but the shield’s duration drains faster as a result.  

### **Special Interactions:**  
- **Fire:** If the player catches fire, the fire effect will only last **1 second**.  
- **Freeze:** If the player is frozen, the shield **immediately breaks**, and the freeze effect is also removed.  

### **Trade-offs:**  
The shield’s lifetime shortens when:  
- Taking damage (due to damage reduction).  
- Actively healing (if not at full health).
